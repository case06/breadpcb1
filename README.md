# BreadPCB1

This is the source repo for the "BreadPCB1"-Projekt


This is a remix of the AltoidsPCB from bborncr, see https://github.com/bborncr/AltoidsPCB


I have added a numeration which makes it easier to find the correct hole when transfering some parts from a breadboard. Furthermore i have connected the three outer hole-rows in the same manner like the inner ones, to extend this breadboard-typical kind of connections on them. This can be helpful in some applications, where each single row may count.


The KiCAD-sourcefiles of the current version can be viewed or modified with KiCAD version 5.0.2 or higher.
